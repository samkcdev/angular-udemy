# Angular from udemy course


Studied so far:
<b>Data Bindings</b>
<b>String Interpolation: {{}}</b>
<p>Used to show the data printed on the template.</p>

Property Binding:[disabled]="Boolean value": Bind a HTML property and change it.
Event Binding:(click)="methodName()": Event binding is used to make changes to the template based on the users event the mouse click etc.
Two-way Binding [(ngModel)]=""
With two-way binding we can change the value of property in template as well as value in the component logic.
